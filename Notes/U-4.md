**Google Cloud Compute Services**

**App Engine**

App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform to deploy and Scale your applications in GCP. It is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering. It comes with a whole end to end application management. App Engine supports many languages like Java, Python, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, Go, .Net with pre-configured runtimes and frameworks. It also supports custom runtimes and can write your code in any language. Using App Engine also allows you to connect to variety of Google Cloud Storage services like Cloud SQL, Cloud Datastore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Endpoints, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Trace, Cloud Debugger, Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, Cloud SDK, Cloud IAM, Cloud Deployment Manager, Cloud Security Scanner, Cloud Mobile App, Cloud VPN, Cloud DNS, Cloud CDN, Cloud Interconnect, Cloud Router, Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud CDN, Cloud DNS, Cloud CDN and many more.

There are no usage charges for it and you only pay for the resources you use. It is highly scalable and also handles load balancing while keeping health checks and monitoring in place. These platforms are managed by the Google team and you don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure. You can also have your applications versioned and can roll back to previous versions if needed. It also supports traffic splitting and canary deployments. 

**Compute Engine vs App Engine**

- Compute Engine
  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - It is more flexible as you have more things in control.
  - You also have to manage the underlying infrastructure.
    - Choosing Image
    - Installing the Software
    - It also allows you to choose the hardware configuration.
    - You have fine grained access or permissions to the underlying infrastructure.
    - It lets you to have the certificates and firewalls in place.

- App Engine
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - It is a serverless platform and you don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
  - So as it comes with the lesser amount of responsibility
  - It is more restrictive as you don’t have much control over the underlying infrastructure, which makes it less flexible.

**App Engine Environments**

*Standard Environment:* This is a kind of a sandbox environment where you can only use the pre-configured runtimes and frameworks which means you can only run specific languages.

- V1: It is the first generation of App Engine and if you have application running with older versions of Java, Python, PHP, Go, Node.js, Ruby, .Net, you can use this environment.
- V2: It is the second generation of App Engine and it supports newer versions of Java, Python, PHP, Go, Node.js, Ruby, .Net. It also supports custom runtimes and you can write your code in any language.
- If you have an application in app engine you will not have access to the OS and Disk. You can't edit the configurations of the OS and Disk. 
- App Engine also supports the scaling down to zero instances if there is not traffic to your application. It also supports auto scaling and can scale up to 1000 instances. It also supports traffic splitting and canary deployments. This also helps in saving the overall cost of the application.

*Flexible Environments:* This is an environment where the instances run within the Docker Containers on the Google's Infrastructure.

- Flexible Environment makes the use of Compute Engine instances and you have more control over the underlying infrastructure.
- Flexible Environment supports any of the runtime with the built in support for Java, Python, PHP, Go, Node.js, Ruby, .Net.
- Flexible Environment cannot scale down to zero instances, it will always have at least one instance running.

**Kubernetes**

Kubernetes is a popular open source container orchestration solution. It provides the cluster management with the upgrades and rollbacks. Each cluster can have different types of virtual machines.

It provides all the important container orchestration features like:

- AutoScaling
- Load Balancing
- Health Checks
- Self Healing
- Service Discovery
- Secrets Management

Google Cloud has a Managed Kubernetes Service named Google Kubernetes Service. GKE minimizes the operational overhead of managing Kubernetes clusters. It also uses the latest version of Kubernetes and also supports the latest features of Kubernetes. It also provides the integration with other Google Cloud Services like Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Trace, Cloud Debugger, Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, Cloud SDK, Cloud IAM, Cloud Deployment Manager, Cloud Security Scanner, Cloud Mobile App, Cloud VPN, Cloud DNS, Cloud CDN, Cloud Interconnect, Cloud Router, Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud CDN, Cloud DNS, Cloud CDN and many more. This mananged service also provides Pod and Cluster Autoscaling.

GKE uses a container-Optimized OS, a hardened OS built by Google. GKE supports for the persistent Disks and Local SSD.

*Autopilot Mode - GKE*

This is the new mode of Google Kubernetes Engine. In this mode, it reduces your operational costs in running the kubernetes clusters. This mode is fully managed and gives you an hands-off experience in managing the cluster infrastructure and the nodes. Here the GKE will manage the clusters for you and you don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure.  

*Creating a GKE Cluster with a simple deployment and scaling it*

- Go to the Kubernetes Engine and click on the Create Cluster.
![GKE Cluster 01](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/12ce63c83c24291fe39ba9776b6843eba51d24b2/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-22%20143256.png)
- It will take you to the Create Cluster page but here it will take you to create the Autopilot Cluster, but we need to create the Standard Cluster. 
![GKE Cluster 02](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/12ce63c83c24291fe39ba9776b6843eba51d24b2/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-22%20143417.png)
So Click on the Standard Cluster option on the top. When you will be switching it to the Standard Cluster, it will give you a prompt you with the features of Autopilot clusters which it offers. Click on Switch to Standard Cluster.
![GKE Cluster 03](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/12ce63c83c24291fe39ba9776b6843eba51d24b2/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-22%20143704.png)
- Set the default project through the CLI.
```
gcloud config set project <project-id>
```
![GKE Cluster 04](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/80dbff7226d837e43b645b1570dd9cce1c735c72/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20203927.png)
- Create the cluster with the default configurations.
![GKE Cluster 05](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/80dbff7226d837e43b645b1570dd9cce1c735c72/Images/console.cloud.google.com_kubernetes_add_project%3Dqwiklabs-gcp-01-8e5d0b86b258%26cloudshell%3Dfalse.png)
- When you create a cluster it will look like this in the Kubernetes Engine Dashboard.
![GKE Cluster 06](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/5e4e37b84b86bb255beb4f3994e8eb2bf878ac22/Images/console.cloud.google.com_kubernetes_clusters_details_us-central1-c_my-cluster_details_project%3Dqwiklabs-gcp-01-8e5d0b8.png)
- Click on Connect to get the command to connect to the cluster. You can also connect to the cluster using the Cloud Shell.
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster --zone us-central1-c --project qwiklabs-gcp-01-8e5d0b86b258
```
After running the above command, you can check for the nodes in the cluster using the following command:
![GKE Cluster 07](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/eb12952bdf4473fad42fed165eb60fd1475a6274/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20205914.png)
- Now, we will be creating a deployment in the cluster, For which we will be getting the sample code for creating and running containers and deployments
```
gsutil -m cp -r gs://spls/gsp053/orchestrate-with-kubernetes .
cd orchestrate-with-kubernetes/kubernetes
```
![GKE Cluster 08](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/84f7cf532a35757f201d660b6f2146cf581ac338/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20211420.png)
- Now, we will be creating a deployment in the cluster, For which we will be getting the sample code for creating and running containers and deployments. Here We will be changing the image name to the following:
...
containers:
- name: auth
  image: "kelseyhightower/auth:1.0.0"
...
Using the following command we will open the file in the editor:
```
vi deployments/auth.yaml
```
![GKE Cluster 09](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/42b3d1bf4953ea75802a9e7f8b5966de0062755b/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20212006.png)
- Now, we will be creating a deployment in the cluster, For which we will be getting the sample code for creating and running containers and deployments.
```
kubectl create -f deployments/auth.yaml
```
![GKE Cluster 10](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/cd02d99471c3edebc31b41cd23e32679d846d680/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20212753.png)
- Once the deployment is created, Kubernetes will create a ReplicaSet for the deployment. You can verify that a ReplicaSet was created for the deployment
```
kubectl get replicasets
```
![GKE Cluster 11](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/3acb12e6d2a0fd2fba5b3813b2e4fbd9c3c3c16b/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20212931.png)
- View the Pods that were created as part of the deployment. The single Pod is created by the Kubernetes when the ReplicaSet is created
```
kubectl get pods
```
![GKE Cluster 12](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/527afd15cd3a443bfe29e0f0c78f96e3dc6524d0/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20213206.png)
- Now we will be creating the auth service. We will be using the following command to create the service.
```
kubectl create -f services/auth.yaml
```
![GKE Cluster 13](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/446cbf1b228eb5f899b28f54e56ecb44db79aea3/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20213705.png)
- Now, do the same thing to create and expose the hello deployment:
```
kubectl create -f deployments/hello.yaml
kubectl create -f services/hello.yaml
```
![GKE Cluster 14](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/c5e4418dd3084d4705bb7ef2a21f828a84eb8ca4/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20213941.png)
- Now, we will be creating amd exposing the frontend deployment. We will be using the following command to create the deployment.
```
kubectl create secret generic tls-certs --from-file tls/
kubectl create configmap nginx-frontend-conf --from-file=nginx/frontend.conf
kubectl create -f deployments/frontend.yaml
kubectl create -f services/frontend.yaml
```
![GKE Cluster 15](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/304e8553bc11bf2ae96c8f192e58baa247473777/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20214328.png)
- Now, Interact with the frontend by grabbing its external IP:
```
kubectl get services frontend
```
![GKE Cluster 16](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/c3f7e95a0a469a67cc761450eb7954a359e8de0d/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20214650.png)
- Now, we will be curling to it:
```
curl -ks https://35.238.174.117 
```
![GKE Cluster 17](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/99326befb58f687cc5c428bde1cd0eac1b3d2a4e/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20214951.png)
- Now, You can look at an explanation of this field using the kubectl explain command again:
```
kubectl explain deployment.spec.replicas
```
![GKE Cluster 18](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/36d01f3ab015bf4eca338b4b8e51cd8ad87a7f8f/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20215335.png)
- Now, we will be scaling the hello deployment to 5 replicas:
```
kubectl scale deployment hello --replicas=5
```
This is the manual scaling of the pods.
![GKE Cluster 19](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/56d2050cf556f7ef3773a8ea78c7e7d8382c738e/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20215730.png)
- You can also increase the number of nodes in the cluster:
```
gcloud container clusters resize my-cluster --num-nodes=4 --zone us-central1-c
```
This is the manual scaling of the cluster.
- Even if we want we can configure the autoscaling of the cluster, so that it can scale up and down based on the load. But this will be autoscaling your microservices and not the cluster.
```
kubectl autoscale deployment hello --min=2 --max=10 --cpu-percent=50
```
When you hit the application with the load, it will scale up and when the load is less it will scale down.
*What goes behind the curtains regarding the command run is that it creates a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) object in the cluster. You can check for the autoscaler object using the following command:*
```
kubectl get hpa
```
- Now, we will be throwing a bit of light onto the auto scaling for your kubernetes cluster. We will be using the following command to create the cluster autoscaler:
```
gcloud container clusters create my-cluster --num-nodes=2 --enable-autoscaling --min-nodes=1 --max-nodes=10 --zone us-central1-c
```
- Now, we will be checking the scaled replicasets:
```
kubectl get deployments
```
![GKE Cluster 20](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/40b1c5323faf3666ba441f8527977cdff1865ca8/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20215949.png)
- Now, we will be checking the replicasets:
```
kubectl get replicasets
```
![GKE Cluster 21](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/40b1c5323faf3666ba441f8527977cdff1865ca8/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20220036.png)
- Now, we will be checking the pods:
```
kubectl get pods | grep hello- | wc -l
```
![GKE Cluster 22](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/e5f5064485531e7ce893542e25ae821dcf0113cf/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20220425.png)
- Now scale back the application:
```
kubectl scale deployment hello --replicas=3
```
![GKE Cluster 23](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/08391cfe83d8ac5ef4c4e46274ee2d7711acc9fd/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-23%20220644.png)
- Now, we will be checking the pods:
```

**Google Cloud Functions**

Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment that allows developers to create the single-purpose, stand-alone functions which respond to the Cloud Events without the need to manage a server or a runtime environment. It is a Function as a Service (FaaS) offering. Cloud Functions allows you to run the code in response to certain events. Here you can write that business logic in Node.js, Python, GO, Java, .Net and Ruby. Here you don't need to worry about the servers or scaling or availability of the application. Here you just need to take care of the code and logic. Cloud Functions is an event driven service and you only need to pay based on:

- Number of invocations and the duration of the execution.
- Compute time of the invocations
- Amount of memory and CPU provisioned for the function.

Every Cloud Function is time bound which means it has a default time of 1 Minute and Maximum 9 Minutes(540 Seconds) and with the Cloud Functions v2 the Maximum time is 60 Minutes(3600 Seconds). Each execution runs in a seperate instance and the instances are created and destroyed on demand but there will be no direct sharing of the resources between the invocations.

**Creating a Cloud Function**

In this part we will be creating a cloud function.

- Firstly, we will be setting the default region for the project.
```
gcloud config set compute/region REGION
```

- Now we will be creating a 1st Generation Cloud Function. Go to the Cloud Functions and click on the Create Function.

- Here we need to create a function on the top of the cloud storage bucket. So we will be choosing the Cloud Storage as the trigger. As we haven't created the Cloud Storage Bucket, we will be creating it here. So click on Browse and Create Bucket.
![Cloud Function 01](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/4c4291f820725b3ca8a385e0e620c495d1c19fe2/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-25%20231304.png)

- Now, it will be creating the cloud storage bucket for us and while that goes on we will creating a trigger based on the Cloud Storage Bucket where the event type will be *(on finalizing/creating file in the selected bucket)*, Here we will be not moving ahead with the *Retry on failure*.
![Cloud Function 02](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/4c4291f820725b3ca8a385e0e620c495d1c19fe2/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-25%20231437.png)

- Now, we will be moving to the code part of creating an function, where we will be choosing the Inline Editor and the Runtime as Node.js 20 and setting the Entrypoint as *helloWorld* and enter the following code in the index.js file:
```
/**
* Background Cloud Function to be triggered by Pub/Sub.
* This function is exported by index.js, and executed when
* the trigger topic receives a message.
*
* @param {object} data The event payload.
* @param {object} context The event metadata.
*/
exports.helloWorld = (data, context) => {
const pubSubMessage = data;
const name = pubSubMessage.data
    ? Buffer.from(pubSubMessage.data, 'base64').toString() : "Hello World";

console.log(`My Cloud Function: ${name}`);
};
```

- Click on the Create button to create the function.

- Now we will be verifying the status of the created function. For that we will be using the following command:
```
gcloud functions describe my-first-cloud-function
```
![Cloud Function 06](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/4c4291f820725b3ca8a385e0e620c495d1c19fe2/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-25%20232333.png)

- Now we will be hitting the function with the following command:
```
DATA=$(printf 'Hello World!'|base64) && gcloud functions call my-first-cloud-function --data '{"data":"'$DATA'"}'
```
![Cloud Function 07](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/4c4291f820725b3ca8a385e0e620c495d1c19fe2/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-25%20232621.png)

- Now we will be checking the logs of the function under the logs section of the function deployed,
![Cloud Function 08](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/4c4291f820725b3ca8a385e0e620c495d1c19fe2/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-25%20232710.png)

- Now we will be opening this in logs explorer and it will look like this:
