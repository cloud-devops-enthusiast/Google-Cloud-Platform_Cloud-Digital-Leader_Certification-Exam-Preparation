It comes with a whole end to end application management. App Engine supports many languages like Java, Python, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, Go, .Net with pre-configured runtimes and frameworks. It also supports custom runtimes and can write your code in any language. Using App Engine also allows you to connect to variety of Google Cloud Storage services like Cloud SQL, Cloud Datastore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Endpoints, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Trace, Cloud Debugger, Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, Cloud SDK, Cloud IAM, Cloud Deployment Manager, Cloud Security Scanner, Cloud Mobile App, Cloud VPN, Cloud DNS, Cloud CDN, Cloud Interconnect, Cloud Router, Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud CDN, Cloud DNS, Cloud CDN and many more.

**Compute Engine vs App Engine**

- Compute Engine
  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - It is more flexible as you have more things in control.
  - You also have to manage the underlying infrastructure.
    - Choosing Image
    - Installing the Software
    - It also allows you to choose the hardware configuration.
    - You have fine grained access or permissions to the underlying infrastructure.
    - It lets you to have the certificates and firewalls in place.

- App Engine
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - It is a serverless platform and you don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
  - So as it comes with the lesser amount of responsibility
  - It is more restrictive as you don’t have much control over the underlying infrastructure, which makes it less flexible.
