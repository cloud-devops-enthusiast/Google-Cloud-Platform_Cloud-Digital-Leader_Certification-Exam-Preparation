**Cloud Identity and Access Management**

**IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

We have multiple number of resources and services in Cloud which requires access and permissions to carry out the work. Here the *Identities* come in place through which human or non-human identities access these resources and perform access. For example there is an adminstrator who needs access to the servers and keep the patches or the services running well which is an example of a human identity and there is an application which needs to access or retrive the data from the database servers here comes the non human identity.

In GCP, Identity and Access Management lets the users to configure the resources they can access and configure the actions which needs to be allowed. There is one thing you should start with giving the least number of privilege to the end user.

This IAM thing is all about the Authentication (Is the right user?) and Authorization (Do they have right access to do that task). Here the identities can be A GCP User (Google Account or Externally Authenticated Users) or A group of GCP Users or An application that is running in GCP or Can be an application which is running in your data center or An Unauthenticated users. This whole IAM lets you have granular control over the resources and limits you to a single user to perform a single actions on a specific cloud resource from a specific IP address during a specific time window.

*Cloud IAM Example*

You want provide access of a specific cloud storage bucket with one of your colleague with permissions to manage with the actions like Upload and Delete objects. *Roles* are the set of permissions which are used to perform certain set of specific actions on specific resources. Roles do not know about the members, here the roles are all about the permissions. For assigning the permissions to a member we need to assign or bind a role to a member. In context you can say a Role is a set of rules which allows the assigne to do those all authorized work.

For instance there is a role named *roles/compute.admin* which provides you full control of all the Compute Engine Resources, you assign this role using a Policy. Here you will be creating a Policy binding member(which can be any user) with the roles(set of rules or permissions).

*Cloud IAM Roles*

IAM Roles consits of a set of permissions that allows you to perform spec
