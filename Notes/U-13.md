**Cloud Native**

In easiest way, it is reffered to a application which is cloud independent and cloud agnostic. Cloud native consists of cloud technologies like microservices, container orchestrator, etc. It is designed in this way that you can get the best value from the google cloud. It is designed in such a way from the ground to take advantage of the elasticity and distributed nature of the cloud.
Here elasticity indicates to the flexibility that comes with the cloud provider which lets you have resources on the go like when you need servers you provision them and when your work is done you just simply release them.

Here the main goal is to achieve the increase in software delivery velocity and increase service reliability while increasing the collaboration among the stakeholders here it is your development team, business team, operations team can work together.
