**DEVOPS in GCP**

*DevOps*

DevOps bridges the gap between the Business, Development and operations team where every team focuses on their individual specified tasks. This whole process is for the sake of making the process of communication (Taking the team at a single platform), in Feedback (Taking regular feedbacks and fixing it in the early stages only) and last is the Automation (Which involves of Automation testing, infrastructure provisioning, deployment and monitoring).

*DevOps- CI, CD*

- Continuous Integration: It takes the control from the code commit step taking it to the next step of having your unit tests as of anything fails it will be easy to fix the things right on the go and packaging the software seamlessly.

- Continuous Deployment: Here you continuous deploy to the test environments.

- Continuous Delivery: This lets you have your newest approved version of the software to be deployed in the production environment.
