**DEVOPS in GCP**

*DevOps*

DevOps bridges the gap between the Business, Development and operations team where every team focuses on their individual specified tasks. This whole process is for the sake of making the process of communication (Taking the team at a single platform), in Feedback (Taking regular feedbacks and fixing it in the early stages only) and last is the Automation (Which involves of Automation testing, infrastructure provisioning, deployment and monitoring).

*DevOps- CI, CD*

- Continuous Integration: It takes the control from the code commit step taking it to the next step of having your unit tests as of anything fails it will be easy to fix the things right on the go and packaging the software seamlessly.

- Continuous Deployment: Here you continuous deploy to the test environments.

- Continuous Delivery: This lets you have your newest approved version of the software to be deployed in the production environment.

Things which we can do:

- Static Code Analysis    
  - This process involves the check for the coding standards while being committed into the version control for which we can use the softwares like lint or sonar.
  - You can also have the static security checks which lets you to identify the security issues for which you have softwares like Veracode or static code analyzer.

- Runtime Checks
  - You can detect the flaws in your applications by running the vulnerability scans using the automated tools that can scan the web applications for the security vulnerabilities.

- Tests
  - You can use tools like JUnit, pytest or Jasmine for creating the unit test reports.
  - You can the automation tests and integrate them to create the reports using the tools like Selenium, Robot Framework, Cucumber, etc. These tools can be used for the system tests as well which lets you have check wiuh other applications.
  - You can have sanity tests in place which describes well about the basic functionalities of the running application.
  - You can also plan for the regression which can have multiple number of testcases which can give you more coverage over the whole functionalities.

*Devops CI-CD tools*

- Cloud Source Repositories is a service which can be used to store your code and gives you all features of the fully featured, private git repository.

- Container Registry is a managed service similar to of a docker hub which can be stored to your Docker Images.

- Jenkins is a Continuous Integration tool.
 
- Cloud Build is a managed service that lets you build the deployable artifacts or (jars or docker images) from the source code and configuration.

- Spinnaker is a tool that lets you deploy your code while providing multi cloud support and allows you to do seamless deliveries. Here it supports the deployments to Google Compute Engine, Google Kuberenetes Engine and other cloud platforms. Spinnaker supports blue green deployment, A/B deployment or canary deployment strategies.

You can easily create a DevOps based deployment using cloud run and cloud build using below one steps:

- When the developer commits the code into the cloud source repository, it checkouts the code from the cloud source repository.

- As this checkout step gets over the build is initiated to create a Docker Image

- Now after creating the Docker image you need to store it so here you can make use of the container registry.

- Now you can configure this created docker image to be used on Cloud Run
