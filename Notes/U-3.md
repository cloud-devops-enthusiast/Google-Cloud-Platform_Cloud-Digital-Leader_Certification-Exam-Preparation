**Managed Services**

There are many ways to run different flavours of services in the Cloud. Like,

- IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service
- PaaS: Platform as a Service
- SaaS: Software as a Service
- FaaS: Function as a Service
- CaaS: Container as a Service
- DBaaS: Database as a Service
- AaaS: Analytics as a Service
- MaaS: Monitoring as a Service
- SECaaS: Security as a Service
- DRaaS: Disaster Recovery as a Service
- BaaS: Backup as a Service
- STaaS: Storage as a Service
- NaaS: Network as a Service
- Serverless
and many more...

Managed Services are the kind of services that are managed by the Cloud Provider. For example, if you are using a Database as a Service, you don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure, the Cloud Provider will take care of it. You just have to use the service.

**IAAS(Infrastructure as a Service)**

Infrastructure as a Service is the most basic form of Cloud Computing. In this model, the Cloud Provider will provide you with only the infrastructure like Servers, Storage, Networking, etc. Here you'll be responsible for

- Managing the Application Code and Runtimes
- Configuring the load balancing
- Auto Scaling
- OS Upgrades and Patches
- Availability and Fault Tolerance
- Data Backup and Recovery
- Security and Compliance
and many more...

**PAAS(Platform as a Service)**

Platform as a Service is the next level of Cloud Computing. In this model, the Cloud Provider will provide you with the infrastructure as well as the platform to run your application. Here you'll be responsible for

- Configuring (Application and Services)
- Application Code (If Needed)

Cloud Provider is responsible for,

- Managing the Operating System (which includes OS Upgrades and Patches)
- Application Runtime
- Auto Scaling, Availability, Load Balancing, Fault Tolerance

Google App Engine, Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, etc are some of the examples of PaaS.

This PaaS also has a variety of flavours like,

- CaaS(Container as a Service): Which allows you to run your application in a containerized environment.
- FaaS(Function as a Service): Which allows you to run your application in the form of Functions.
- Databases: Which are relational and non-relational databases based on your needs. If you want SQL you have servicesa like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, etc. If you want NoSQL you have services like AWS DynamoDB, Google Cloud Datastore, etc.

**Containers to Container Orchestration**

*Microservices*

![Microservices](https://github.com/cloud-devops-enthusiast/Google-Cloud-Platform_Cloud-Digital-Leader_Certification-Exam-Preparation/blob/da340737270ff132dbd8535f9c670df1ddf8a4aa/Images/l58obbmefqxrq8l81-microservices.png)

In today's world, organizations are shifting towards the Microservices Architecture. These microservices focuses more on the small and independent services rather than a single monolithic application. These microservices are loosely coupled and can be deployed independently. These microservices are also easy to maintain and scale.

Microservices gives you the ability to innovate and build your applications in different ways and also gives you the ability to choose from a variety of languages and frameworks. (GO, Python, Java, Javascript, etc). Still the deployment of these microservices is a challenge. That's where the containers come into play.

*Containers- Docker*

Containers are the lightweight and portable units of software that can be deployed in a variety of environments. So here in the case of microservices, we will be having Docker images for each microservice. Here these Docker Images are the portable units of software that can be deployed in a variety of environments. These Docker Images have all the necessary dependencies and configurations that are needed to run the application. So these Docker Images will have the Application Runtime, which is a necessary requirement to make your application code and dependencies to run. As you have Docker Image you can run it anywhere, whether it is your local machine, data center, or in the Cloud.

Some of the Advantages of Containers are, Docker Containers are lightweight, portable, and can be deployed anywhere. Docker Containers are less bulky as compared to Virtual Machines as they don't have the Guest OS. Docker Containers provides you with the isolation for the containers. Docker is also cloud agnostic, which means you can run your Docker Containers in any Cloud Provider.

*Container Orchestration*

Having your applications Containerized is not sufficient. You need to have the whole lifecycle in place. Container Orchestrators are the tools that are used to manage the lifecycle of containers. These Container Orchestrators are used to manage the deployment, Auto-scaling(Scaling based on the demand), Service Discovery(Allowing the microservices to find each other), Load Balancing(Distributing the load of traffic across multiple instances of a microservices), Self Healing(Which helps to have a healthy running containers at any point and replacing the failing containers with the healthy instance), Zero Downtime Deployments(Release new version without causing downtime), networking, and availability of containers. Some of the popular Container Orchestrators are Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, etc. Among these Kubernetes is the most popular Container Orchestrato and most of the cloud providers are providing the managed Kubernetes services like AWS EKS, Google Kubernetes Engine, Azure Kubernetes Service, etc.

**Serverless**

Serverless is the next level of the Cloud Computing. In simple words it removes all the pain and headache of managing the servers.

But, Serverless does not mean it does not have servers. It does have servers but you don't have to worry about them. You just have to focus on your application code and the Cloud Provider will take care of the rest.

Here you don't have visibility into the underlying infrastructure, which lets you have the Flexible Scaling and Automatically have the high availability in place. You just have to pay for what you use. You don't have to pay for the idle time. You can also have the ability to run your application code in different languages and frameworks.

One of the key things to remember is that in Serverless you pay for the requests and the execution time not for the servers.

Some of the examples of Serverless are AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, etc.

**Software as a Service(SaaS)**

Software as a Service is the next level of Cloud Computing. This is the most advanced form of Cloud Computing. In this model, the Cloud Provider will provide you with the complete software that you can use. You don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure, platform, or the software. You just have to use the software. It is mostly a centrally hosted software which is deployed mostly on the cloud, which comes on a Subscription based model. Examples of SaaS are Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, etc.

**Shared Responsibility Model**

This kind of model tells about the responsibilities of the Cloud Provider and the Customer. GCP gives you the security features like Encryption, Identity and Access Management, KMS, etc. But it is your responsibility to use them. GCP will not use them for you. Based on the model you choose, the responsibilities will be shared between the Cloud Provider and the Customer.

For Instance, you are using *SAAS* then the cloud provider is responsible for most of the things like the infrastructure, platform, software, etc. But you are responsible for the data with the access policies and usage. For *PAAS* the Cloud Provider is responsible for the infrastructure and platform and you are responsible for the deployment, web application Security with all the SAAS responsibilities. For *IAAS* the Cloud Provider is responsible for the infrastructure and you are responsible for the Operations, Network Security, Guest OS, with all the PAAS and SAAS responsibilities. For *On-Premise* you are responsible for everything.

*Some Things to Remember:*

- Google App Engine is an example of PaaS.

- Compute Engine Virtual Machine is an example of IaaS.

- Cloud Run allows you to run one container quickly.

- Compute Engine allows you to have a cutsomized operating system and software.
