**Google Cloud Architecture**

*Loose Coupling with Pub/Sub*

Whenever you want to decouple a publisher, consider Pub/Sub. Here Pub/Sub is used in the microservice architectures, IOT Architectures, Streaming Architectures. Here the architecture goes like you have mobile apps, on-prem services running or IOT services which are running and sending stream to Topic which is further being used with the subscriptions which takes the data to their different destinations like datawarehouse or much more.

*Cloud Dataproc*

Cloud dataproc is a fully managed and highly scalable service for running Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop based workloads. It supports variety of jobs like Spark, PySpark, SparkR, Hive, SparkSQL, Pig, Hadoop. This is mainly used to perform the complex batch processing.

It has multiple cluster modes like Single Node, Standard or Highly Availibility which has 3 masters nodes. It makes use of the virtual machine or regular/preemptible VMs.

Usecase: This is used to move your Hadoop and Spark clusters to the cloud. This lets you perform your machine learning and AI development using the Open Source frameworks.

Alternative to dataproc is BigQuery which can be used to run SQL queries on Petabytes. You can go towards Dataproc if you need more than queries (Example: Complex Batch processing machine learning and AI workloads).

Alternative to dataproc is Dataflow which can be simple pipelines without managing clusters and it is serverless so you do not need to manage the servers by yourself.
