**Digital Transformation**

*Enterprises Need to Adapt*

- This lets enterprises provide an awesome(omni-channel-social, mobile) customer experiences.
- This lets you gather the intelligence from the data that lets you have services over Big Data, AI/ML.
- Enterprises allows themselves to make the changes faster. This can be a cultural change from the "traditional datacenter, SDLC, Manual IT Ops" to "Cloud, Containers, DevOps/SRE, Automation".

*Digital Transformation*

Using the today's technologies with the cutting edge tech you can create (or modify) the business processes and the customer experiences by innovating with the tech and the team culture.

Here it makes the focus on increasing the pace of change, revenue growth, cost savings and Higher customer engagement and retention.

*Cloud Enabler for Digital Transformation*

- Cloud lets you enable the digital workspace at a lower cost, while reducing the resposibilities so if you want you can shift towards the IaaS, PaaS or SaaS models, Also there are higher capabilities while increasing your speed to market.

But when it comes to overall change you need to have right skills with the right mindset and culture for implimenting the things. When you move with all of these things in mind you need to have a mordern architecture knowledge (microservice, serverless, containers, kubernetes.) Plan about shifting towards the agile model process of having things like DevOps and SRE in place to make automation.

With all these there should be suitable environments with the right talent and right culture which lets you have data driven experimentation and innovation.

*Google Cloud Adoption Framework*

- It is a streamlined framework which lets you adopt the cloud seamlessly.

- There are four themes in this framework:
1. Learn: You need team-mates with the right skills to make your technology adoption a right choice.
2. Lead: You need to structure your team in such a way so you they can cross-function, brainstorm, experimenting and innovating.
3. Scale: This is one of the most important thing that lets you to have everything at a scale and automate all your tasks from the manual processes, which consists of processes like Provisioning and scaling infrastructure, application releases, monitoring.
4. Secure: This lets you protect the unauthorized and inappropriate access that lets you control, strategies and technology.

- There are three phases in this whole adoption process:
1. Tactical: This is the phase that lets you move to the cloud with the minimum changes to the whole process including the people's, processes and technology. Here you can make use of IaaS which is mainly used for cost savings. This is more of like moving with bare minimum changes 
2. Strategic: This is about making some degree of changes to the process or technology and the people's associated with it and this is an isolated part of an enterprise. Here it is more of done by harnessing additional value of cloud.
3. Transformational: This phase lets you fully invest in the cloud technologies and make the organization cloud first, fully automated and cross functional feature teams. This phase is more of driven by data and intelligence while adopting and SRE practices.

*Infrastructure Modernization*

- Lift and Shift: This is a process of moving all your present infrastructures AS-IS to the Google Cloud's infrastructure. Example is Virtual Desktop Solution: This lets you have a virtual desktop solution on google cloud.
