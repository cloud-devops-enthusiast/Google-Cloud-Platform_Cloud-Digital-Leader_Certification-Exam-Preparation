*Managing Google Cloud Resources*

*Hierarchy*

Google Cloud follows a very well defined hierarchy, which consists of a Organization under which there is a Folder and under that comes the Project followed by its Resources under it.

Organization > Folder > Project > Resources

Resources are created inside of the projects, where as there are Folders which can accomodate multiple projects, and these folders comes under of an Organization.

*Organizing Practices*

- You must create seperate or individual projects under the folders for the different environments, like for instance you can plan for test environments and production environments so if the projects will be different in this case you will be able to get much better level of isolation and access management between both of the environments.

- You can also plan and create seperate folders for the each department which make the overall handeling of projects way easier.

- Likewise we can plan for the shared resources to keep them in a separate folder which does not let them share the resources.

- Here we consider a use-case for having *One Project Per Application per Environment*

Here we have two application named "App1" and "App2" which are needed to be deployed into two environments named "Env1" which is more of the development environment and "Env2" which is the production environment.

 So as we have 2 applications and 2 environments we will be distributing them as per the needs which makes a combination which is best in terms of isolation and have a granular or great access management on these environments for instance only the environments developer can access be the Env1 and not let them get into the production environment which will let you achieve great control and stability over everything. As per this whole condition the Developer can do their experimental changes or Perform actions like Creating new features, Deleting the existing features or Deploying some changes or improvements to the environment.

 So we will be having four project in place with combination of application and environment like: A1-Env1, A1-Env2, A2-Env1 and A2-Env2 which will not bring the dev changes to the PROD and will let you give access of the production evironment to the operations team only.

 *Biling Account*

 Billing Account is the most mandatory thing to create the resources inside of the project, This billing account consists of the payment details. Ultimately you can say Billing Account is the main thing to run a project. Every project that consists of active resources must have a billing account.

 Here these billing accounts can be linked or associated with one or more projects else you can have multiple billing accounts inside of a single organization.

 Recommended Practice: You can create Billing Accounts based on the Organization structure:

 - Here a startup can have just have one billing account.

 - For a large enterprise you can have a seperate billing account for each department.

 Here there are two types of billing accounts:

- *Self-Serve:* This kind of billing account is billed directly to the credit card or bank account.

- *Invoiced:* Here the generated invoices are used by the large enterprises.

*Managing Billing- Budgets, Alerts and Exports*

We need to pay for whatever we use in cloud as it works on the pay as you go model, so as the billing gets generated you can have Cloud Billing Budget setup, which lets you have some alerts in place like we have budgets when we plan to have something at home.

So here we configure the alerts as the thresholds are met you get an alert, there are default alerts set to 50%, 90% and 100%. Here the Billing admins and Billing Accounts will be alerted by email or you can have Pub Sub setted up for sending the alerts to it.

This billing data have only two types of export and can be exported (on a schedule) to multiple cloud services:

- BigQuery: You can use this cloud service in case you want to query information or visualize it.

- Cloud Storage: This can be used to store for the purpose of history or archiving.

*IAM Best Practices*

- Principle of Least Privilege: Give the most least amount of privilege or access required for the role. Here's why Basic roles are not recommended here as these provides a wider scope and that's why its better to have predefined roles in place whenever it is possible.

- Use Service accounts with the minimum rights and privileges and you can have different service accounts for different kind of apps and purposes.

- Seperation of Duties: You must break-down the sensitive tasks and have atleast 2 people's involved in these types of tasks, this will not let a dependency to be created in place.

  - Example: Having seperate deployer and traffic migrator roles in the Cloud Environment. 

    - App Engine comes with 2 roles, one is App Engine Deployer and App Engine Service admin Role where the role of An App Engine Deployer is to deploy an application to a new version but App Engine deployer would not be able to perform other tasks like shifting the traffic or cannot modify the existing versions of the application, where as the another role of App Engine Service admin allows the user to shift the traffic and not allowing the same person yp jto a new version.

*Constant Monitoring*

This monitoring lets you review the cloud audit logs to audit the changes to the IAM policies and gives you the access to the Service Account Keys. Here you can have the Archived cloud audit logs stored in the cloud storage buckets for the long time retention.

You can have the team members aligned or grouped into Groups which can be efficient way of delivering the services at the best. For example you have 10 peoples in the deployment team with their distinguished roles and one team member who sees over the build is absent and in his/her absence the team will receive the message and can fix the build likewise by some other person of the team, here the group gets involved and leads to better efficiency.

*Public vs Private vs Hybrid Cloud*

- Public Cloud: Public cloud is a model that lets you have on-demand resources, services and infrastructure that are managed by the third party providers and shared with multiple organizations and customers using the public internet connectivity. Public cloud services lets you have cloud based services like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) for users to use them on demand and pay by month or pay as you go model, eliminating the users to have these services hosted in your own environments. Public cloud lets you eliminate the need of the datacenter anymore and there is no need to pay for the hardware as you're renting the hardware for the moment and have the power to unlimited scale at your disposal. Here the hardware resources are owned by the Google Cloud where they need to do the capacity management, hardware failures and security of the data center are Google Cloud's responsibility.

- Private Cloud: Private cloud is a cloud computing model that is dedicated to a single user while keeping the hardware hosted at the organization's own datacenter at a third party colocation facility or via a private Cloud Provider who offers private Cloud hosting service. It is more like of raising your grain yourself to make bread for yourself. Here when you have your hardware then you have to put a lot of capital expenditure and also invest in staffing and maintaining the expenses for the infrastructure. In the private cloud model if you want some additional infrastructure you must need to have planning ahead of time as it is expensive and time consuming at the same time. For instance you released a new product and the traffic gets increased exponentially, you will have to plan likewise and you cant suddenly bring servers from anywhere.

- Hybrid Cloud: A Hybrid cloud consists of both of the elements of the public and private cloud which lets you have a flexible mix of the cloud computing services. It is more of like having some workloads on the Public cloud whereas using other environments for other usecases. For example Using Google Cloud Dataflow service to process a data stream from your on premise applications. Here you can also connect an on premise application to Google Cloud SQL database. This cloud model gives with a lot of flexibility where you can switch based on your requirement between the public and private cloud computing model. There is one major drawback of this as there will always going to be a bridge between the cloud and the private datacenter environment will be increasing the complexity.

- Multi-Cloud: Multi cloud is the next version of the hybrid cloud that lets you have a mix of multiple public cloud services. When you are moving to multi cloud, these services utilize a combination of on-premise, public cloud, public cloud and edge to build, operate, access and secure their applications consistently across the cloud. Multi cloud comes with more flexibility but at the same time it increases the complexity.

*Cloud VPN*

Cloud VPN lets you connect on-premise network to the GCP network by peering your network to Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using an IPsec VPN connection. Here the traffic which travels between two networks which is encrypted by One VPN Gateway and then decrypted by the other VPN gateway. This action protects your data as it travels through the internet. Here the traffic is encrypted using the Internet Key Exchange protocol.

There are two types of Cloud VPN solutions:

- *HA (High Availability) VPN* (This provides SLA of 99.99% service availability with two external IP addresses). This only supports dynamic routing (BGP).

- *Classic VPN* (This provides SLA of 99.9% service availability, a single external IP addresses). This supports static routing (policy-based, route-based) and dynamic routing using BGP.

*Cloud Interconnect*

Cloud interconnect lets the external
