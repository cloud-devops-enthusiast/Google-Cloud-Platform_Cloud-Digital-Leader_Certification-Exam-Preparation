*Managing Google Cloud Resources*

*Hierarchy*

Google Cloud follows a very well defined hierarchy, which consists of a Organization under which there is a Folder and under that comes the Project followed by its Resources under it.

Organization > Folder > Project > Resources

Resources are created inside of the projects, where as there are Folders which can accomodate multiple projects, and these folders comes under of an Organization.

*Organizing Practices*

- You must create seperate or individual projects under the folders for the different environments, like for instance you can plan for test environments and production environments so if the projects will be different in this case you will be able to get much better level of isolation and access management between both of the environments.

- You can also plan and create seperate folders for the each department which make the overall handeling of projects way easier.

- Likewise we can plan for the shared resources to keep them in a separate folder which does not let them share the resources.

- Here we consider a use-case for having *One Project Per Application per Environment*

Here we have two application named "App1" and "App2" which are needed to be deployed into two environments named "Env1" which is more of the development environment and "Env2" which is the production environment.

 So as we have 2 applications and 2 environments we will be distributing them as per the needs which makes a combination which is best in terms of isolation and have a granular or great access management on these environments for instance only the environments developer can access be the Env1 and not let them get into the production environment which will let you achieve great control and stability over everything. As per this whole condition the Developer can do their experimental changes or Perform actions like Creating new features, Deleting the existing features or Deploying some changes or improvements to the environment.

 So we will be having four project in place with combination of application and environment like: A1-Env1, A1-Env2, A2-Env1 and A2-Env2 which will not bring the dev changes to the PROD and will let you give access of the production evironment to the operations team only.
