**Google Compute Engine**

For deploying applications you need servers, and for servers you need hardware. In Cloud you rent those virtual servers, which are called *Virtual Machines* (VMs). These VMs are hosted on Google's infrastructure. These VMs are called *Compute Engine*. Here as they come under the Google Cloud's umbrella there is a service that is called as *Google Compute Engine* which is used to provision and manage these VMs. These VMs are called *Compute Engine VMs*.

This Compute Engine service allows the user to manage the whole lifecycle (This lifecyle involves creating a VM, Start or Stop a VM, Restart or Terminate a VM and many more such operations) of the VMs. Here you can plan for autoscaling and Load balancing for multiple VM instances. Compute Engine allows allows the user to attach storage or add network storage solutions for the VMs and have your needed Operating System onto these drives. This Service comes with multiple options like allowing the users to have the networking connectivity and configurations for the VMs, have the security and access control for the VMs, have the monitoring and logging for the VMs and many more such options in their hands.
