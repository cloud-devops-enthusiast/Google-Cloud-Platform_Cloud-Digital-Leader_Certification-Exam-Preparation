**Databases in Google Cloud**

While moving ahead with the databases you first need to understand the requirement or use-case of your data storage. There are some factors on the basis of which you can identify the factors:

- Do you want a fixed schema, while maintaing the flexibility for defining and keep changing the schema (Schemaless).

- What level of the transaction properties do you need to maintain the atomicity and consistency.

- What kind of the latency you are expecting out of it like based on second, mili-second or micro-second latency.

- How many transcations you're expecting with the databases like hundreds, thousands or millions of transactions per second.
