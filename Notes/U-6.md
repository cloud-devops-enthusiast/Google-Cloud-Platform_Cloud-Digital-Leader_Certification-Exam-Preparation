**Databases in Google Cloud**

While moving ahead with the databases you first need to understand the requirement or use-case of your data storage. There are some factors on the basis of which you can identify the factors:

- Do you want a fixed schema, while maintaing the flexibility for defining and keep changing the schema (Schemaless).

- What level of the transaction properties do you need to maintain the atomicity and consistency.

- What kind of the latency you are expecting out of it like based on second, mili-second or micro-second latency.

- How many transcations you're expecting with the databases like hundreds, thousands or millions of transactions per second.

- What amount of data you are going to store like MBs or GBs or TBs or PBs.

**Relational Databases**

Relational Databases are the types of databases in which the data is stored with the predefined schema with tables and relationships. RDBMS comes with very strong transactional capabilities. This kind of databases are usually a perfect fit for OLTP(Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP(Online Analytics Processing) use cases.
