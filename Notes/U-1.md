**Regions and Zones**

**Regions**

Regions are the specific geographical locations around the world where your resources are located. Different regions have different pricing. You can choose the region where you want to deploy your resources. You can also choose to deploy your resources in multiple regions. Distributing your resources in multiple regions can help you to achieve better availability, lower latency and better overall performance. These regions comply to the local laws and regulations of the country where they are located which also helps you to gain compliance and increase the security of your resources while also increasing the global footprint of your resources.
