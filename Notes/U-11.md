**Loosely Coupled Applications with cloud pub/sub**

*Asynchronous Communication: Decoupled*

Applications usually makes the synchronous calls to the logging service, consider a case when your logging service goes down with this whether your application will go down too or In case if there is too much load on the and there are too much logs being generated will the application will go down too.

```
Web Server --> Topic --> Logging Service --> Database
```

Here the Asynchronous Communication for the decoupled applications comes into place, it is more of like everything is placed in seperate block rather than a single block. Here you're intended to create a topic and have your applications put the log messages on the topic. Logging service picks them up for processing when ready.

Advantages of such kind of architecture is that 

- Decoupling: Here the publisher (Apps) don't care about who is listening.

- Availability: Under which the Publisher (Apps) up even if a subscriber (Logging Service) is down.

- Scalability: Scaling the consumer instances (Logging Service) by increasing there number under the high load.

- Durability: Messages are not losted even if the subscriber (Logging Service) is down.

*Pub/Sub*

Pub/Sub is a highly Reliable, Scalable, Fully-Managed asynchronous messaging service which is mostly the backbone for Highly Available and Higly Scalable Solutions. Here you do not need to worry about scaling as it works on autoscaling to process billions of messages per day. At Pub/Sub your costs stays low as you just pay for what you use. Pub/Sub supports both push and pull message deliveries.

Some of the usecase of the Pub/Sub cab be event ingestion and delivery for streaming analytics pipeline.

*Working of Pub/Sub*

- Publisher: Publisher is the sender of the message. here the publisher sends the messages by making HTTPS requests to pubsub.googleapis.com.

- Subscriber: Subscriber is the receiver of the message. On Pull transaction Subscriber pulls the message when it is ready. Here the subscriber makes HTTPS requests to pubsub.googleapis.com. On Push transaction the message is being sent to subscribers, where the Subscriber provide a web hook endpoint at the time of registration. When a message is received on the topic, A HTTPS POST request is sent to the webhook endpoints.

It is flexible with the subcribers and publishers relationships: It can be One to Many, Many to One and Many to Many.

*Pub/Sub: Getting ready with Topic and Subscriptions*

1. Topic is created.

2. Subscriptions are created.
    - Subcribers register to the topic
    - Each subscription represents discrete pull of messages from a topic
        - Multiple Clients pull the same subcription => Messages splits between the clients
        - Multiple Clients create a subscription each => Each client will get every message

*Pub/Sub: Sending and Receiving the messages*

- Publisher sends the message to a topic.

- Message gets individually delivered to each other and every subscription
    - Subscriber can receive message either by:
        - Push: Pub/Sub sends the message to a subscriber.
        - Pull: Subcriber poll for messages

- Subscriber sends the acknowledgements

- Messages are removed from the subscriptions message queue.
    - Pub/Sub ensures the message is retained per subcription until it is acknowledged
