- Consuption based model is that where you are billed for only what you use. For example: Cloud Functions where you pay for the number of invocations or Cloud Storage where you pay for only the amount of data you store in the cloud storage.

- Fixed Price model where you pay for the instances whether you make use of them or not. Example can be a VM instance, you pay for that VM instance whether you pay for it or not, another example can be a GKE Cluster where you pay for the cluster irrespective of you deploy any application to it or not.
